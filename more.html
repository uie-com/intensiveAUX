                                program to UX leaders</strong></a> to help them build their organization’s UX strategy.
                        The UX leaders in the program tell us it’s unlike anything they’ve ever done, producing amazing
                        results faster than ever before.</p>
                    <p>However, because there’s nothing out there like it, it’s really hard to explain. UX leaders who
                        are thinking about joining us don’t realize the amazing impact it will have on how they’ll
                        deliver substantial improvements to their UX efforts. It’s really hard to know just how much
                        benefit this program delivers until you’ve experienced it.</p>
                    <p>That’s why we’ve taken a tiny piece of the <strong>Center Centre UX Strategy Leaders
                            program</strong> and offer it in the form of this free, 1-week Intensive. It’s a close
                        approximation to what each of the 24-weeks in the program are like, enough so everyone can get
                        an idea. </p>
                    <p>This is our way of demonstrating what we’re best at: <em>helping folks make substantial
                            improvements in how UX is valued throughout their organization.</em> Enjoy the “free taste.”

                    <p>Each day between Monday, May 17 and Friday, May 21, there is <strong>1 main session with Jared
                            Spool</strong>. </p>
                    <p>You can catch the main discussion either by attending:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>the Live Discussion at 2pm ET (18:00 GMT) each day

                    </ul>
                    <p>If you really want to get the most out of the Intensive, you should set aside 30 minutes per day
                        to work on your homework. The homework is directly related to the work you’re doing at your
                        organization. In other words, it’s work you already need to do. </p>
                    <p>And if you really, really want to take the Intensive to the next level and get the most value out
                        of it, you’ll join us on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 10am ET or (14:00 GMT) for our live
                        <strong>Implementation and Inspiration sessions</strong>. This is your chance to have Jared
                        Spool dive deep into your homework and get your questions answered.</p>
                    <p>We understand that these times may not be convenient for you. Maybe the sessions take place when
                        you are sleeping. If this is the case, please don’t worry. We’ve got you covered. <strong>All
                            sessions will be recorded</strong> and available to watch until Monday, May 31, at 2pm ET.
